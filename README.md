**🏥 Patient Segmentation for Preventive Healthcare**

📌 Project Overview
In healthcare, not every patient requires the same care path. This project uses machine learning to cluster patients into segments based on age, billing history, and health attributes — enabling smarter, targeted preventive care.

🎯 Objective
To identify natural patient groupings using clustering techniques so that healthcare providers can:

Deliver tailored care

Optimize resources

Personalize medical interventions

🧠 Approach
Dataset: Kaggle - Healthcare Dataset by prasad22

Techniques Used:

Data cleaning + encoding

Scaling numerical features

PCA for dimensionality reduction

KMeans clustering (unsupervised learning)

Heatmaps and scatter plots for cluster visualization

🔍 Key Insights
High-billing clusters likely represent chronic patients — prime candidates for specialized programs

Low-billing, younger segments may benefit from preventive, digital-first care plans

Differences in age and room utilization across clusters can support smarter inpatient/outpatient planning

💼 Business Impact
Improves Care Efficiency: Match care delivery to patient needs

Reduces Over-treatment: Flag low-risk groups early

Supports Proactive Care: Enables population-level health targeting

Optimizes Costs: Helps reduce unnecessary clinical workload

🧰 Tools & Tech
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn (KMeans, PCA)

Seaborn, Matplotlib (for storytelling and visualization)
